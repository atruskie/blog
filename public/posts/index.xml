      <description>I have tried many times to start a blog. I think it&amp;rsquo;s important for me to write often because writing is something I have difficulty concentrating on. Some might find my distaste and associated boredom with writing ironic given I elected to do a PhD&amp;hellip; but I digress.
Required features These are the requirement I have always wanted for a blog platform:
 Free hosting Complete customisation Complete transparency&amp;ndash;As a professional point of pride, I need to understand how it all works Minimal overhead&amp;ndash;I don&amp;rsquo;t want to be patching (even more) servers  Putting those requirements together, I decided I wanted to use a static website generator.</description>

      <title>Investigating Excessive Memory Usage in Redis</title>

      <description>At www.ecosounds.org we use Resque as our asynchronous job processing system. Resque was created, used, and open sourced by GitHub. It is a queue based implementation built on top of Redis. Redis is an in memory, key-value store (a database) that is exceptionally fast.
The system has its limitations but has generally worked pretty well for us. Weâ€™ve run in excess of a million jobs through Resque and we consider that to be a decent amount for a small site like ours.</description>

      <title>Switching Vagrant to Hyper-V</title>

      <description>I use Vagrant to script and automate virtual machines used for development purposes. When I first started using Vagrant I didn&amp;rsquo;t really understand its utility or its place in the development cycle. Now though I&amp;rsquo;m quite happy in my understanding that it is just a automation layer, a scripting abstraction, used to paste over the differences of different virtualization layers&amp;ndash;most of the time at least.
There are of course other alternative to using virtual machines for development environments.</description>
