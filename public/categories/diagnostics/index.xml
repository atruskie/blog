      <description>At www.ecosounds.org we use Resque as our asynchronous job processing system. Resque was created, used, and open sourced by GitHub. It is a queue based implementation built on top of Redis. Redis is an in memory, key-value store (a database) that is exceptionally fast.
The system has its limitations but has generally worked pretty well for us. Weâ€™ve run in excess of a million jobs through Resque and we consider that to be a decent amount for a small site like ours.</description>
