      <description>I use Vagrant to script and automate virtual machines used for development purposes. When I first started using Vagrant I didn&amp;rsquo;t really understand its utility or its place in the development cycle. Now though I&amp;rsquo;m quite happy in my understanding that it is just a automation layer, a scripting abstraction, used to paste over the differences of different virtualization layers&amp;ndash;most of the time at least.
There are of course other alternative to using virtual machines for development environments.</description>
