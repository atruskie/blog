      <description>I have tried many times to start a blog. I think it&amp;rsquo;s important for me to write often because writing is something I have difficulty concentrating on. Some might find my distaste and associated boredom with writing ironic given I elected to do a PhD&amp;hellip; but I digress.
Required features These are the requirement I have always wanted for a blog platform:
 Free hosting Complete customisation Complete transparency&amp;ndash;As a professional point of pride, I need to understand how it all works Minimal overhead&amp;ndash;I don&amp;rsquo;t want to be patching (even more) servers  Putting those requirements together, I decided I wanted to use a static website generator.</description>
