This is my tech blog. I'm interested in software development and architecture. I'm
a generalist programmer that regularly uses a variety of operating systems,
platforms, and programming languages. You can expect a bit of everything here.

In my day job I'm a Research Software Engineer (RSE) working at QUT. A RSE is
a professional that works with academics, writing the software that powers modern
research. While the term _Research Software Engineer_ is new, it codifies the
work post-docs, PhD students, and research assistants have been doing for decades.
