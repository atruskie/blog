I have tried many times to start a blog. I think it's important for me to write
often because writing is something I have difficulty concentrating on. Some
might find my distaste and associated boredom with writing ironic given I
elected to do a PhD... but I digress.

## Required features

These are the requirement I have always wanted for a blog platform:

- Free hosting
- Complete customisation
- Complete transparency--As a professional point of pride, 
  I need to understand how it all works
- Minimal overhead--I don't want to be patching (even more) servers

Putting those requirements together, I decided I wanted to use a static website
generator. Ever since GitHub Pages introduced me to the concept of static site
generators, I've found it ridiculous that WordPress required an active
installation of a web server and a database. All this extra overhead for running
a dynamic web application is just too much complexity for what a blog (or for
that matter many other websites) need.

I decided on these requirements years ago and if I had given in and just
used a hosted blogging service I would have been up and running and
happy.

Nonetheless, unreasonable persistence.

## Attempt 1: Jekyll + GitHub Pages

## Attempt 2: MetalSmith

## Attempt 3: Hugo
